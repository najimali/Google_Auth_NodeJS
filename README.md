### What is OAuth

It stands for Open Authentication & is one of the approach for user authentication inside your app & allows third party services like Google,Facebook,Github etc.

As a user, it's very often we choose to use our Google (or Facebook, Twitter, etc) account to sign into a web application, as it is more convenient and quick than creating a new log in account. Usually the process goes like this:

1. You click "Sign in with Google" button
2. You get redirected to a Google consent screen, asking if you grant 3. 3. permission for the app to gain access to your Google profile info
   You click "Allow"
3. Get redirected to the actual application
